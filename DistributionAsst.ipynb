        "\n",
        "Many real-world datasets are positively skewed, meaning they have a long right tail. Applying a logarithm compresses large values more than small values, which reduces the effect of extreme values (outliers).\n",

        "By reducing skewness, the distribution becomes more symmetric and closer to a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Log transformation also stabilizes variance because it makes the spread of data more consistent across different levels of the variable. When variance increases with the mean, taking logarithms helps control this growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, log transformation improves normality, reduces the impact of outliers, and makes data more suitable for statistical analysis.\n",
