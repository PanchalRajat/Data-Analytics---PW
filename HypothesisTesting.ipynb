        "\n",
        "-->  \n",
        "The null hypothesis (H₀) is a statement that assumes there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables in a population.\n",
        "\n",
        "It represents the default or initial assumption that any observed difference in data is due to random chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The null hypothesis is important because it provides a clear basis for statistical testing. Hypothesis testing is designed to evaluate whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "By testing H₀, researchers can make objective decisions using data rather than assumptions, which helps ensure reliability and scientific validity of conclusions.\n",

        "### Question 2: What does the significance level (α) represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "-->  \n",
        "The significance level, denoted by α (alpha), represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, α is the risk of making a Type I error, which occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected.\n",
        "\n",
        "It sets the threshold for deciding whether the observed results are statistically significant. Common values of α are 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the p-value obtained from a test is less than or equal to α, the null hypothesis is rejected; otherwise, it is not rejected.\n",

        "\n",
        "-->  \n",
        "Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. This error is also known as a false positive and its probability is represented by the significance level α.\n",
        "\n",
        "Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false. This error is also known as a false negative and its probability is represented by β.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms, a Type I error means detecting an effect that does not actually exist, while a Type II error means failing to detect an effect that actually exists.\n",

        "\n",
        "-->  \n",
        "A one-tailed test is a hypothesis test in which the direction of the effect is specified. It checks whether a parameter is either greater than or less than a certain value, but not both.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a one-tailed test:  \n",
        "If a company claims that a new machine increases average production above 100 units, the test checks whether the mean production is greater than 100.\n",
        "\n",
        "A two-tailed test is a hypothesis test in which no specific direction is mentioned. It checks for any significant difference, whether greater than or less than a certain value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a two-tailed test:  \n",
        "If we want to test whether the average production is different from 100 units, the test checks for both increase and decrease from 100.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, a one-tailed test looks in only one direction, while a two-tailed test looks in both directions.\n",

        "### Question 5: A company claims that the average time to resolve a customer complaint is 10 minutes. A random sample of 9 complaints gives an average time of 12 minutes and a standard deviation of 3 minutes. At α = 0.05, test the claim.\n",
        "\n",
        "-->  \n",

        "\n",
        "-->  \n",
        "A Z-test should be used instead of a t-test when the population standard deviation (σ) is known and the sample size is large (usually n ≥ 30).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is because the Z-test uses the standard normal distribution and gives more accurate results when σ is known, whereas the t-test is designed for situations where σ is unknown and estimated from the sample.\n",
